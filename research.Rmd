My research interests are identities and narratives in politics. Theoretically, I am interested in how political identities are formed, evolved over time, transmitted through narratives, and spreaded via social networks. Empirically, I am interested in China and would like to focus on the historical and present-day origins of Chinese nationalism and Chinese attitudes towards ethnic minorities.
