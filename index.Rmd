Welcome! My name is Juan Qian, and I am a PhD student in the [Political Science Department](https://polisci.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My major fields are comparative politics and methodology. 

Prior to graduate school, I served as an Associate in Research at the Margolis Center for Health Policy at Duke University from 2016-18. Additionally, I also worked for several government agencies and and think tanks, including Minnesota Senate, Office of Minnesota Governor, and American Enterprise Institute.

I come from Nanjing, a city in eastern China. I graduated from Macalester College with a B.A. in political science in 2014 and obtained my Master of Public Policy from Georgetown University in 2016.
