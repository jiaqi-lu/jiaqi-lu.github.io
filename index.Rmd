Welcome. My name is Jiaqi (Jackie) Lu, I am a Senior Academic Researcher with the Global China Initiative at the Boston University [Global Development Policy Center](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/). I received a joint-Ph.D. in Political Science and Environmental Studies from the University of Wisconsin–Madison (2018-2023). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Walsh School of Foreign Service at [Georgetown University](https://global.georgetown.edu/georgetown_units/edmund-a-walsh-school-of-foreign-service) (2023-2024) and a Predoctoral Fellow at the  [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.belfercenter.org/) (2021-2022). My research interests include the political economy of energy transitions and climate change, as well as the intersection of governance and technology development. My research has appeared or forthcoming in Nature Geoscience, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Energy Research & Social Science, Energy Policy, Environmental Research Letter, and so on. 

I received my B.A. in Sociology and M.A. in International Public Affairs (2014) from UW-Madison. Before returning to Madison for Ph.D. in 2018, I was a research analyst at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/) (2015-2018), where I worked on energy and climate policy. 

I welcome any advice and feedback about my research work. Please do not hesitate to [send me an email](mailto:jl1@bu.edu).
